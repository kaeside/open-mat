# Project Open Mat


Open mat is an app that allows you to find martial art gyms nearby that offer open mats. It uses geolocation to retrieve user location and then makes use of geospatial Mongoose queries to find nearby gyms by given parameters. Open Mat currently uses "dummy data" for gyms near San Francisco, Berkeley, and other East Bay locations. Because there is no good, central resource on the web for finding open mats in the bay area, I plan to get the data myself to help local martial arts enthusiasts. I also plan on creating a feature for users to add gyms, which will then undergo a verification process.

## To do:

1. Add search by city feature.
2. Add better styling. 
3. Acquire more data by calling gyms and doing research online.
4. Add more search parameters, including cost, discipline, and time.
5. Add user submission feature.

I am currently available for hire!
